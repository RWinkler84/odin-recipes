  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Green salad doesn't look that nice, because it is all dark green - just like goo. It also doesn't taste to well - mostly bitte and sometimes like mud - but it is really "bon pour la sant√©" like the french say.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Green leafes</li>
    <li>Avocado</li>
    <li>Cucumber</li>
    <li>Green Bell Pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember: If it's not green, it's not in! It is a green salad after all.</p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut everything in to mouth sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Throw it into a bowl and mix it up.</li>
    <li>Don't you dare to add any kind of dressing. This should be healthy, not tasty.</li>
  </ol>
